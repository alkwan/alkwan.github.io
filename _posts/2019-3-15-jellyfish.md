			What makes a great mobile phone? Why do people choose and stick to certain operating systems, like Android or iPhone? These were the types of questions my group asked ourselves as we tackled creating a brand new mobile operating system. We got into the nitty gritty of what we liked and disliked about current devices and began brainstorming ideas for a new device of our own. Since we were creating something entirely new, we decided to focus on an audience of young, tech-savvy, professionals. As we narrowed this down, we found a few key aspects to focus in on: <b>personalization</b> and <b>ease of use</b>.
