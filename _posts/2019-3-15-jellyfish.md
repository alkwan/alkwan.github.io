			<h4>The Problem</h4>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/current_tech_proscons.PNG" alt="Whiteboard with pros and cons."/></span>
			What makes a great mobile phone? Why do people choose and stick to certain operating systems, like Android or iPhone? These were the types of questions my group asked ourselves as we tackled creating a brand new mobile operating system. We got into the nitty gritty of what we liked and disliked about current devices and began brainstorming ideas for a new device of our own. Since we were creating something entirely new, we decided to focus on an audience of young, tech-savvy professionals. As we narrowed this down, we found a few key aspects to focus in on: <b>personalization</b> and <b>ease of use</b>.

			<h4>Our Solution</h4>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/jellyfish/moodboard.gif"/></span>My team started by creating a mood board that conveyed the look and feel of our imagined operating system. Using the mood board as inspiration, we created a design language, for which we came up with seven design principles. Our operating system was to be <b>animated</b>, <b>fluid</b>, <b>iridescent</b>, <b>tactile</b>, <b>modern</b>, and <b>personalized</b>. We wanted users to have a smooth, responsive, and enjoyable experience. With these principles in mind, we laid down the ground work for our OS by identifying and creating user journeys, common layouts/design patterns, and interaction design. Once we had this foundation, we designed 10 apps total, presenting our designs once a week and getting feedback from our professor and TA.</p>

            <h4>Research and Planning</h4>
			<!-- Animation research -->
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/jellyfish/jellyfish.gif"/></span>During our process, we identified <b>animated</b> as one of our design principles. We would later find it too difficult to implement in our final designs, but I was tasked with the job of researching and coming up with UI animation. While I am familiar with 3D character animation, this was my first time attempting UI animation. Using tutorials and example files online, I created these animations in Adobe After Effects.</p><p>To the left is my first attempt at line animation in After Effects, and below are the UI animations I created. Interface designs were not done by me.</p>

			<h4>Messages App Design</h4>
			<!-- Messages app -->
			<p>For one of our 10 apps, I created the Messages app. I started out by doing some competitive analysis of other existing messaging apps. I picked out the elements that I liked and disliked, then combined them and made sure they matched our design language</p>
			<h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>

			<h5>Initial Designs</h5>

			<span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/images/jellyfish/messages_v2.png"/></span>
			<h5>Final Designs</h5>
			<p>When we got near the end of the project, we decided not to finish the Messages app design. However, at this point, we realized we had strayed from our established design language and were stuck in a rut. We scrapped our previous designs, and I created less extensive versions that better reflected what we wanted for our look and feel.</p>

			<h4>Icon Library</h4>
			<!-- Created a library of ~80 icons -->
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/jellyfish/icon_library.png"/></span>My biggest contribution to this project was the icon library. In our initial designs, we used icons from various icon libraries that we found online. However, this made visual consistency difficult. In order to fix this, I created entirely new icons in Adobe Illustrator, making sure they were stylistically consistent. I ended up making roughly <b>80 icons</b>, and almost all of the icons used in our final designs were created by me. To the left are most of icons I made for the project, and below are some of our final screens that show them in use.</p>
