			<h4>Problem and Solution</h4>
			<p>Being a new student at a giant university can be hard. For almost 7,000 new students every year, finding classes on a campus that covers over 700 acres is almost impossible, and discovering available clubs and events can be overwhelming. My teammates and I decided to address both of these problems by creating a navigation app that not only autoloads your schedule and helps you get around campus, but also allows you to discover new clubs and events that are otherwise hard to find.</p>
			<h4>My Work</h4>
			<p>For this project, I conducted user interviews to find out the problems that students faced when they were new on campus, as well as investigate the solutions that students did use. These interviews revealed some major points: <b>campus was huge and hard to get around</b>, <b>finding information about clubs online was nearly impossible</b>, and <b>most students did very little with their between-class downtime</b>. These three takeaways helped us focus the app design.</p>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/navU/info_200_award.jpg"/></span>Most students used Google Maps to get around, which let us focus less on the actual directions portion of the app and more on finding information about buildings and events. My interviews also led to the discovery that most buildings on campus do not have visible signs, making them hard to identify.</p>
			<p>Afer conducting research, I created user personas to help inform our designs. Finally, after another member created our initial paper wireframes, I designed the user interface and screens that would be used in our final prototype. At the INFO 200 project fair, our group won the Best UX/UI Award.</p>

			<!-- Redesign  -->
			<h3 id="elements">Redesign Overview</h3>
			<!-- add bit about 7,000 new students on campus and how it's important for them to find their interests (and how it's hard for them to find a community/club/interests/activities/etc) in this section!! -->
			<p>This project made me realize that I could not only do UX/UI design, but that I very much enjoyed it. But looking at it two years later, I knew that I could do better. I started over and returned to the user interviews that I conducted, and came to new conclusions.</p>
			<p>In the previous iteration, we focused on directions. But reading the interviews again, I realized that the biggest problem people faced was finding clubs, a community, and events to go to between classes. So I shifted the app's focus: instead of being a navigation-based app, I decided to create a schedule/event app with navigational capabilities.</p>
