            <h3 id="elements">Project Overview</h3>
            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>Invisible illnesses are chronic illnesses that do not present any outwardly identifiable or visible symptoms. This definition is incredibly broad, and applies to diseases from depression and anxiety to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Because this definition is so broad, it is impossible to know the number of people affected by invisible illness--but the numbers are high.</p>
            <p>My capstone team and I discovered that three major problems facing this community. The first is that, while there are lots of resources available for adults, there are very few resources available for youth and adolescents. Second, there is very little representation of invisible illness in media, and when it does exist, it is often romanticized and dramatized in ways that are inaccurate. Lastly, there is a lack of awareness within the broader community about the problems that these people face.

            <h4>Our Solution</h4>
            <p>In order to address these problems, my capstone group decided to create a video game that follows the journey of a 14-year-old girl who suddenly falls ill and tries to find a diagnosis. We decided on creating a video game for three specific reasions. First, video games are <b>influential</b>. More than 150 million Americans play video games, and 60% of Americans play video games daily. Second, video games are <b>accessible</b>. Android apps can be downloaded anywhere in the world. Because we used Unity for our game, we can also port our game to multiple platforms and languages. Finally, video games are <b>experiential</b>. Video games have a unique ability to foster empathy between the players and characters, making it an ideal platform for us to use.</p>

            <h3 id="elements">My Work</h3>
            <h4>Initial Concept</h4>
            <p><span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/bysf/rae_concept_sketch_01.png" alt="First concept for But You Seem Fine."/></span>Our group met up at the beginning of fall quarter, knowing only that we wanted to create a game for our senior capstone project. One day, while eating lunch by myself, I was suddenly struck with an idea. About 4 years prior, I had written a single page comic about the time I fell ill during middle school and missed 2 or 3 months of school (in later years, I would be diagnosed with a sleeping disorder, narcolepsy). For some reason, the comic popped up in my mind, and I had an idea: what if I turned that comic into a game? I pulled out my notebook and immediately scribbled the drawing to the left. While I hadn't, at the time, done any research about the impact of invisible illness, there were two reasons why I wanted to pursue this game.</p>
            <p>First of all, being a kid dealing with illness was incredibly lonely. I didn't know anyone else my age that was dealing with illness like I was, and the only time I saw illness depicted in media was in medical dramas. Secondly, I knew that it was a story that people would relate to. After presenting my single page comic for class, several classmates came up to me afterwards about how they had experienced the same thing, with a different diagnosis. These were people who didn't feel recognized or seen by mainstream media. After hearing this reasoning, my team decided to go ahead with the idea. We then decided on the type of video game to create. As a longtime video game player, I immediately knew I wanted the game to be a visual novel with a choose your own adventure style of narration. That way, the player made choices and influenced the story, but also got to be put in the shoes of the main character.</p>
            <h4>Story and Preproduction</h4>
            <p>During winter quarter, we focused on solidifying the game's story and visual style. In its first iteration, my idea for the story revolved around Rae Kim, a high schooler who just got diagnosed with narcolepsy. My idea was to focus on how her invisible illness affected her daily life.</p>

            </div>
            <p style="text-align:center">The main character, Rae, went through many iterations before we settled on a final design.</p>
            <p>Although this was the initial idea, we felt as though not including the diagnosis process would make the story harder to relate to. We talked about how the comic I had made originally resonated with so many people specifically because there are so many similarities in people's stories when it comes to looking for doctors. Therefore, we decided to pivot. Instead of starting the story after Rae's diagnosis, the story would begin as she started her first semester of high school and follow her journey as she became mysteriously ill.</p>

            <p style="text-align:center">My initial story outline, before we changed it.</p>
            <p>There were a lot of difficulties to this process. I am the only member of our group who has an invisible illness, so the group depended on my experience in order to tell an accurate story. I was charged with writing the outline for our game since I was most familiar with the process. To do this, I wrote down the chronological events of everything that had happened during middle school. This was much harder than I anticipated.</p>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/images/bysf/journal_entry.png"/></span>
            <p style="text-align:center">Reliving the diagnosis process was difficult and required a lot of personal analysis on my part.</p>
            <p>Bringing up my struggles with the team helped me get through this process, and I was able to create an outline without too much trouble. I handed this outline off to my team mate Maddie, who then wrote the first draft of the game's script. Once she finished the first draft, I edited it, focusing on accuracy and grammar. After several rounds of edits and proofreads, we finished the script.</p>
            <h4>Minimum Viable Product and Feedback</h4><span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/bysf/bysf_twine.png"/></span>
            <p>After finishing the script, we focused on creating our final deliverable for winter quarter: our minimum viable product. We decided early on that our MVP would be a text-based version of our game with no visuals. We chose to use an open source text engine called Twine, which let us import our script and have the base functionality of a visual novel: make choices and get to different endings. After successfully porting our script to Twine, we published our game to Itch.io and sent out a Google form for feedback.</p>
            <p>Over spring break, we got 9 responses to our Google Form, with plenty of feedback. We learned several key things from this feedback. One, it was hard to feel the passage of time when Rae was visiting doctors. Two, users didn't feel an immediate impact when they made choices. Three, some of our endings seemed unfair. Working with this feedback, we spent a week rewriting the script and story. The major changes we made were to include transition screens to let the user know how much time had passed, adding more events in between doctors visits, and changing how the stats that determined our endings were distributed.</p>

            <h4>Transition to Unity</h4>
            <p>After updating our script, we were off to the races, scrambling to import our existing game into Unity. One of our team members tried to code our game using just Unity, but because we had such a short timeline (9 weeks if you don't count the week we spent changing the script), we opted to use a third party package called Visual Novel Engine. This engine was vital to our success and saved us a lot of time in the development process.</p>
            <p>While my teammates were importing the script into Unity, I focused on drawing all the character emotions that we would need later on in the process. To do this, I read the script and marked the places I thought needed an expression, writing down the emotion. I then sketched, inked, and colored these emotions for the three main characters (Rae, her mom, and her best friend Sadie).</p>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/images/bysf/rae_emotions_done.png"/></span>
            <p>After finishing these character emotions, I then imported all the sprites to the game and implemented each emotion change. During this process, I quickly realized that the 20 emotions I started with would not be nearly enough. I ended up creating 112 sprites total: 50 emotions for Rae, 28 for her mom, and 34 for her best friend.</p>
            <p>Once I was finished with implementing the character emotions, I finished designing and creating the textures for the user interface. As a team, we felt that the UI that came with Visual Novel Engine was clunky, unappealing, and hard to understand. After testing different UI on my phone using Figma, I created the new textures to make our UI both more aesthetically pleasing and easier to understand.</p>
