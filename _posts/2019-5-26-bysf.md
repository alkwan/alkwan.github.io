            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>Invisible illnesses are chronic illnesses that do not present any outwardly identifiable or visible symptoms. This definition is incredibly broad, and applies to diseases from depression and anxiety to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Because this definition is so broad, it is impossible to know the number of people affected by invisible illness--but the numbers are high.</p>
            <p>My capstone team and I discovered that three major problems facing this community. The first is that, while there are lots of resources available for adults, there are very few resources available for youth and adolescents. Second, there is very little representation of invisible illness in media, and when it does exist, it is often romanticized and dramatized in ways that are inaccurate. Lastly, there is a lack of awareness within the broader community about the problems that these people face.

            <h4>Our Solution</h4>
            <p>In order to address these problems, my capstone group decided to create a video game that follows the journey of a 14-year-old girl who suddenly falls ill and tries to find a diagnosis. We decided on creating a video game for three specific reasions. First, video games are <b>influential</b>. More than 150 million Americans play video games, and 60% of Americans play video games daily. Second, video games are <b>accessible</b>. Android apps can be downloaded anywhere in the world. Because we used Unity for our game, we can also port our game to multiple platforms and languages. Finally, video games are <b>experiential</b>. Video games have a unique ability to foster empathy between the players and characters, making it an ideal platform for us to use.</p>

            <p>Our capstone group met up at the beginning of fall quarter, knowing only that we wanted to create a game for our senior capstone project. We spent this quarter brainstorming ideas and coming up </p>
