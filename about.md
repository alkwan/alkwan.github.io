					<h3>A big nerd</h3>
				</header>
				<p>When I'm not studying or designing, I enjoy a plethora of nerdy things! This includes reading tons of graphic novels and manga, watching lots of animated movies and shows (favorite movie: Princess Mononoke, favorite show: Hilda), and making and playing video games.

					<h3>An artist</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I also love to draw comics and create illustrations! As a previous art major, creating art is one of my passions. I often draw from real life experiences to create amusing short stories, or use comics to express myself in a longer form.</p>

					<h3>A taiko player</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The rest of my time is spent playing Japanese drums, also known as taiko. I joined the University of Washington's taiko club in 2015 and have loved it ever since! I am also secretary for the Regional Taiko Group of Seattle and am excited to help the Seattle taiko community grow.</p>
